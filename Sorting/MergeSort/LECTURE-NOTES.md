# Merge Sort: Lecture Notes
Insertion Sort is considered a simple sort. As such it is a brute force sorting method that meaning it finds the smallest element in an array and swaps it with the first element. Then finds the next smallest and swaps with the second element and so on until the array is sorted. 

Insertion Sort can be done in place giving a space complexity of O(1). It can also allow for an array to be built as items are recieved however, lists over 50 are not optimal for this sort.
