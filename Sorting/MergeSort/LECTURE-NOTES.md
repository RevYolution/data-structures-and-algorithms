# Merge Sort: Lecture Notes
Merge Sort is a divide and conqure sort. The sort continually divides an input array until it cannot divide the array anymore. The array is then merged together and sorted as it is merged. The sort relies on two seperate functions to carry out the sort. The merge function takes in the divided arrays and assumes that they are sorted. The mergesort function calls upon itself to divde an array until there is only one element in the array then passing it to the merge function to be recombined.
