# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that contains nodes which point to another node. Each node can contain data and referance point to next node.


## Challenge
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure
- Node Class (with Next and Value properties)
- LinkedList Class (With Head and Current Properties) as well as
- Constructor to require at least one Node
- Add (O(1))
- Print (O(n))
- Append(O(n))
- AddBefore(O(n))
- AddAfter(O(n))

## What is it used for?

A linked list is used for deletions in constant time, linear lookup time, and constant insertion times.Linked lists are a dynamic data structure not requiring sequencial memory allocation.
