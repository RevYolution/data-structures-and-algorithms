## Approach & Efficiency
Take in a string and convert to a string array. Iterate over the array hashing the words and adding them to a hash table. If a collision occurs check to make sure that the words match. If they do match return the word. If no matches are found return null. 
### Big O
**Time**: O(n)  
**Space**: O(n)
