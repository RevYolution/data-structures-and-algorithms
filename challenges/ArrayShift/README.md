## Description
Algorithm that takes in an array and inserts a new integer value at its midpoint. 

------------------------------

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
$ git clone [https://github.com/RevYolution/data-structures-and-algorithms.git]
```
#### To run the program from Visual Studio:
Select ```File``` -> ```Open``` -> ```Project/Solution```

Next navigate to the location you cloned the Repository.

Double click on the ```ArrayShift``` directory.

Then select and open ```ArrayShift.sln```

Inserting 11 into the array
------------------------------
## Approach & Efficiency
Sets the value of the middle by taking the given array length and dividing it by 2. Sets a counter to zero allowing for the off set of the index and the rewrtting of the array. Loop through the original array until the middle is reached and sets the middle index to the insertion value. Continutes to write the original array according to the counter. 
## Change Log
1.1 Added to README and refactored code.
