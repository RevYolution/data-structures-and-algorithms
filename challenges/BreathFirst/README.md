# Breadth First
##### *Author: Jon Rice*

------------------------------

### Description

Console application that traverses a Binary Tree in a breadth first way outputing each value in order. 
------------------------------

## Getting Started

## Approach & Efficiency
Take in a tree and traverse the tree using Preorder traversial. Recursivly checking the values if they are divisible by 3,5 or 15. If they are the values are replaced by "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" and the modified tree is returned. 
### Big O
**Time**: O(n)  
**Space**: O(w)
